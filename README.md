# Lab3 – Assembly and C I/O Library with Test Programs

This repository contains an x86-64 assembly library for input/output (text and integers), along with:

* A test program written in assembly (`Mprov64.s`)
* A corresponding test program in C (`test_prog.c`)
* A Makefile for building the project

## Features

* Read and write text or integers from/to the terminal
* Buffered input/output for efficiency
* Compatible with both C and Assembly code

## Structure

* `lab3_lib.s` – Core I/O library (assembly)
* `Mprov64.s` – Test program in assembly
* `my_iolib.h` – C header for the I/O library
* `test_prog.c` – Test program in C
* `Makefile` – Build script

## Usage

1. Compile using the provided Makefile
2. Run either the assembly test program or the C test program
3. Follow the terminal instructions
